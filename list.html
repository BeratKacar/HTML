            <dd>ancakes are a quick and easy breakfast dish made from a simple batter. To prepare them, first, mix the dry ingredients—flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt—in a bowl. Then, add the egg and milk, stirring until the batter becomes smooth and free of lumps.

                Next, heat a pan over medium heat and add a little butter or oil to prevent sticking. Pour some batter into the pan, forming a round shape. When bubbles start to appear on the surface, flip the pancake and cook the other side until it turns golden brown.
                
                Once cooked, serve the pancakes with honey, syrup, or fresh fruit for extra flavor. Enjoy your homemade pancakes!</dd>
